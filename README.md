Thank you for taking your time to review our code and dataset. This README.md file describes how to 
run our algorithms and all baseline methods. The folder graph-sto-iht folder contains all datasets 
and code including baseline methods.

You first need to:
    0.  install Python-2.7 and GCC (Linux/MacOS/MacBook already have them.)
    1.  install numpy, matplotlib (optional), and networkx (optional).
    2.  build our sparse_module by executing ./build.sh please check our
        readme.md file. If you do not know how to compile this library.
