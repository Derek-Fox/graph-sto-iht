This library implements the algorithm proposed in /Group lasso with
overlaps and graph lasso/, by Laurent Jacob, Guillaume Obozinski and
Jean-Philippe Vert (ICML 2009).

*Directories*

src: the source code, released under the GPL3 license.

src/blasso: an implementation of the bootstrapped lasso (P. Zhao and B. Yu (2004)).

src/overlib: the functions implementing the group lasso, and the group lasso with overlaps.

data: the breast cancer data of Van't Veer et al. as formated in Chuang et al., the formated pathways from MSigDB and the graph of Chuang et al.

*Important files*

src/overlib/overLasso.m: learn a model using an input loss and the
overlapping group lasso penalty. In practice, we create one duplicate
of each variable for each group to which it belongs. For the group
lasso, we use the active set method of Roth et al., 2008.

src/mainChain.m: an example of use of overLasso using a chain structure on the variables.

src/mainGraph.m: an example of use of overLasso using a grid structure on the variables.

src/mainBCPath.m: an example of use of overLasso using the breast cancer dataset of Van't Veer et al., with the canonical pathways of MSigDB as groups.

src/mainBCGr.m: an example of use of overLasso using Van't Veer's breast cancer dataset, with some subgraphs of the graph of Chuang et al. as the groups.
